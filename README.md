RaceTheRabbit
=============

Holds code for the Race Against the Rabbit Assignment. The program stages a race between two animals; a rabbit and a turtle, name
"Bugs" and "Yertke", respectively.

The two animals are instances of the Animal object, which contains the animals
name, speed, focus (ability to concentrate), and race position. The object also
provides a method to advance the animal's position in the race based on it's
speed, it's focus, and a random number.

The program accepts no user input. It's output is an alert pop-up showing who
won and what distance they achieved.

I ran the program a number of times with various speeds and focus values
assigned to the contestants. With the factors used in today's class, the turtle
is rather reliably, but not exclusively, the winner. Other combinations give
the advantage to the rabbit and may occaisionally produce a tie.
